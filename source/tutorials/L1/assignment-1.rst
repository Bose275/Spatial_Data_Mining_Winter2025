Tasks
==========

.. important::
    Please complete this assignment **by the end of January 20 (06:00 pm on 20 January 2025)**.

The assignment for this week has three parts.
First, you will **set up your Python Environment and GitHub account**.
Next, you will **let us know your GitHub username via D2L**.
Finally, you will **cook up some Python** using the skills you learned during the first tutorial!


Part 1 - Python Environment Setup and GitHub Account Creation
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install Anaconda (Or VS Code ): Follow the provided tutorial steps to install Anaconda (Or VS Code) on your computer. Ensure it's successfully installed and set up according to the tutorial guidelines.

2. Create a GitHub Account: Head over to GitHub's website and sign up for a new account if you haven't already. Fill in the necessary details and create your account.

3. Generate a Personal Access Token: Within your GitHub account settings, navigate to the "Developer Settings" and create a personal access token. Follow the tutorial's steps to generate the token, ensuring you grant it the required permissions.

    - You donâ€™t necessarily need to install Anaconda to complete the assignments. There are alternative options available:
    - **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: You can use VS Code as an alternative to Anaconda. Check out detailed tutorial on setting up VS Code, Python, and Git `here <https://spatial-data-mining-winter2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/L1/vs_code.html>`__
    - **Google Colab**: If you prefer not to install anything locally, you can run all your Python code and markdown tasks interactively in the browser using Google Colab.
    - Regardless of the platform you choose, **ensure you use code versioning and connect your work to GitHub**. This is essential for maintaining your project and submitting your assignments correctly.


Part 2 - D2L Setup and Dropbox Submission
----------------

1. Ensure that you have access to the course's D2L (Desire2Learn) platform. If you encounter any issues accessing the platform despite being registered for the course, kindly reach out to the course instructor via email for assistance.
2. Visit the **Dropbox** page available on the course D2L website.
3. Submit  your **full name, GitHub username, and link to your GitHub profile** in the ``Kick-off Assignment`` section.

For example, ``Reza Safarzadeh, safarzadeh-reza, https://github.com/safarzadeh-reza``.

This will help us know you were able to create your account, that you have also figured out how to use GitHub, and we'll know who is who on GitHub :).

    In case you're curious, we need your GitHub user name in order to access your assignment repositories in GitHub for grading and feedback.


Part 3 - Start Kick-off Assignment on GitHub Classroom
------------------------------------------------------

.. admonition:: Start your assignment

    **You can start working on your copy of kick-off assignment by** `accepting the GitHub Classroom assignment <https://classroom.github.com/a/DYG7-UzZ>`__.


1. Start the coding assignment by accepting the GitHub Classroom assignment (click on the link above).
2. Now you should be able to see one ``README.md`` file and one note book named ``Assignment-0.ipynb`` in the new repository.
3. Read the instructions in both files in the repository. 
4. Launch a new JupyterLab instance (or VS Code workspace) and clone your kick-off assignment repository to your computer.
5. Cook up some Python according to the instructions in the ``Assignment-0.ipynb`` !  *Remember to save your work ;) !*
6. Push your changes into your personal Kick-off Assignment repository using git.


.. note::

    For each assignment, you will create a personal copy of the assignment repository on GitHub.com by clicking on the GitHub classroom link.


.. admonition:: Private repositories

    The assignment repositories are private. They are visible only to you, course instructor, and TA.
